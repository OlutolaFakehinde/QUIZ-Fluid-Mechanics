# Puzzle

![](Quiz.jpeg)

## Brief
As soon as I was introduced to python program by my wonderful teacher Toyin, the first thing that came to my mind was to build a puzzle out of one of my favourite subjects in engineering, Fluid Mechanics.

I tested it with my students in the lecture one day and it worked successfully as expected.

## Construction
The puzzle was constructed with ten random questions from fluid mechanics to test students knowledge of the subject.

When a correct answer is picked, it says ***You are correct*** and adds 1 mark to the score-basket.

when wrong answer is picked, it says ***Oops! You are wrong! The answer is ...***.

At the end, a cumulative scores is shown and the per centage of achievement.

As example:
```
You got 7 out of 10 questions correct!
Your achievement in Quiz-1 =70.0%
Watch out for FLUID MECHANICS Quiz-2 by Olutola Fakehinde
```
## Conclusion
This is project is still under construction and more development is to be added in near future.
